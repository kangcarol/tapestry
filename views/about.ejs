    <p class="about-text">
      Tapestry stems from a project that I started over the Pandemic with my dad. Realizing I had taken for granted the trips to visit my parents on the other side of the world, I started a correspondence with him to record his thoughts, advice and life experiences.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      Tapestry is an app designed for contemplation, sincerity and to cultivate empathy with others not like ourselves.
