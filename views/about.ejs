        Tapestry stems from a project that I started over the Pandemic with <a id="dad-profile" href="/profiles/633ec8a97ec0988a3ad99245">my dad</a>. Realizing I had taken for granted the trips to visit my parents on the other side of the world, I started a correspondence with him to record his thoughts, advice and life experiences.

        Tapestry is an app designed for contemplation, genuine interactions and to learn about others.
