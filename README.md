![screenshot](insert screenshot path)


 ## Description
 **"We don't accomplish anything in this life alone...and whatever happens is the result of the whole tapestry of one's life and all the weavings of individual threads from one to another that creates something." - Sandra Day O'Connor**<br>
<br>
 Tapestry stems from a project that I started over the Pandemic with my dad. Realizing I had taken for granted the trips to visit my parents on the other side of the world, I started a correspondence with my dad to record his thoughts, advice and life experiences.<br>
 <br>
 Tapestry is an app designed for contemplation, genuine interactions and learn about others.<br>
