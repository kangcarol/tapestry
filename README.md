# TAPESTRY

 ## Description
 **"We don't accomplish anything in this life alone...and whatever happens is the result of the whole tapestry of one's life and all the weavings of individual threads from one to another that creates something." - Sandra Day O'Connor**<br>
<br>
 Tapestry stems from a project that I started over the Pandemic with my dad. Realizing I had taken for granted the trips to visit my parents on the other side of the world, I started a correspondence with my dad to record his thoughts, advice and life experiences.<br>
 <br>
 Tapestry is an app designed for contemplation, genuine interactions and to learn about others.<br>

1. AAU Admin, I am the only one who will be able to add/update questions.
2. AAU I want to login/logout to access my Q&As to answer/edit/update, and to read other's Q&As.
3. AAU after logging in, I want to view the latest Q&As answered (a feed).
4. AAU if I want to go back to my feed I can click TAPESTRY on the nav bar.
5. AAU I want to see all my Q&As on one page, and be able to edit or delete.
6. AAU I want my cards to be accessible to READ ONLY by other users. (I want to read other people's Q&A but I shouldn't be able to do anything more than that.)

*note: trying to avoid the things I don't like about social media, such as "likes" which I think spurs on insincere postings online.
